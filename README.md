Dear viewer,

This is a simple Shopping cart made with React with the focus on the Context API. 

What is can do:
- add items to the shopping cart
- remove items from the shopping cart
- calculate the total cost
- display the total amount of items, even if the cart is minimized
- sort the items ( via the size buttons)
- loads a set of items from Firebase
- it has a custom HTTP request hook

Used dependencies:
- React 

Things to bear in mind:

Please leave a comment.

Thank you!
